# Commodities Database (commodities_DB) Case Study
Overview
  This project demonstrates the development and management of a Commodities Database in MySQL designed to track various commodities such as crude oil, gold, wheat, and other 
  market-driven goods. The database tracks critical information like commodity types, suppliers, pricing trends, trade history, and inventory levels. This centralized system 
  is intended to help manage commodities more efficiently and make better decisions based on market data.

  The project uses MySQL as the relational database management system and Python for automation, data analysis, and API integration. GitHub is used for version control, 
  collaboration, and sharing of scripts and reports.

# Project Objectives
  The goal of the Commodities Database is to:

  Track various commodities, their suppliers, and inventory levels.
  Store historical price data and market trends.
  Record trade history and transaction details.
  Provide insights and reporting on commodity market performance.

# Database Components
  1. Commodities Table
  Stores information about different commodities being tracked (e.g., gold, crude oil, wheat).

  CommodityID: Unique identifier for the commodity.
  CommodityName: Name of the commodity (e.g., Gold, Crude Oil, Wheat).
  CommodityType: Type of commodity (e.g., agricultural, precious metals, energy).
  Unit: Measurement unit (e.g., kg, barrel, ton).
  CurrentPrice: Latest price for the commodity.

  2. Suppliers Table
     Contains data on suppliers, including company name, location, and contact information.

     SupplierID: Unique identifier for the supplier.
     SupplierName: Name of the supplying company.
     Location: Location of the supplier.
     ContactEmail: Contact email for the supplier.
 
 3. Inventory Table
   Tracks inventory levels for each commodity across various warehouses.

   WarehouseID: Unique identifier for the warehouse.
   CommodityID: Foreign key referring to the Commodities table.
   Quantity: Quantity of the commodity available in the warehouse.
   LastUpdated: Date and time when the inventory data was last updated.

4. PricingHistory Table
   Records historical price data for each commodity.

   PriceHistoryID: Unique identifier for the price record.
   CommodityID: Foreign key referring to the Commodities table.
   Date: Date the price was recorded.
   Price: Recorded price for the commodity.

5. TradeHistory Table
   Contains data on trades or sales made for each commodity.

   TradeID: Unique identifier for the trade.
   CommodityID: Foreign key referring to the Commodities table.
   BuyerID: Foreign key referring to the Buyers table.
   Quantity: Quantity of the commodity traded.
   TradePrice: Price at which the commodity was traded.
   TradeDate: Date the trade occurred.

6. Buyers Table
   Stores data on customers or buyers purchasing commodities.

   BuyerID: Unique identifier for the buyer.
   BuyerName: Name of the buying company or individual.
